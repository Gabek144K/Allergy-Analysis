# Factors Leading to Asthma Diagnosis 
This analysis expresses the similarity and correlation between Food Allergies and Asthma allergies. 
# Dataset
The data used for this analysis is a real dataset from The Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia, which is both an international referral center and a provider of primary and sub-specialty care services to patients residing in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Utilizing their care network of 1,050,061 urban and suburban children, we defined two retrospective cohorts: (1) a closed birth cohort of 29,662 children and (2) a cross-sectional cohort of 333,200 children. The cross-sectional cohort was utilized to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of the conditions studied. Linear regression was used to determine the extent to which food allergy was associated with respiratory allergy.
# Conclusion 
Finally, the findings indicate that the presence of food allergy is a risk factor for the subsequent development of respiratory allergy (Asthma). These findings provide new insights into the epidemiological characteristics of these diseases, describe the importance of utilizing provider-diagnosis data to complement participant reporting methodologies, and offer vital information to inform future efforts aimed at preventing, diagnosing, and managing these common pediatric conditions.
